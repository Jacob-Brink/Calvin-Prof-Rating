# Calvin-Prof-Rating
Calvin students can see the best professor and his or her rating for each course listed in their progress page. Less time is wasted searching for the best teacher, more time for picking the right course. Want to avoid a course with bad rated professors? If the best teacher's rating is lower than 3, then avoid it. You have to take the course anyway? Make sure you take the course with the best rated professor.

The addon is currently under development, but is available for testing in firefox's addon manager.
Unfortunately, since I was unable to supply a test username and password for Calvin's student progress website, the addon has been taken down.
While I attempt to re enable the addon to be available, use the .xpi package instead if you want to.
