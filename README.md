# Calvin-Prof-Rating
Calvin students can see the best professor and his or her rating for each course listed in their progress page. Less time is wasted searching for the best teacher, more time for picking the right course. Want to avoid a course with bad rated professors? If the best teacher's rating is lower than 3, then avoid it. You have to take the course anyway? Make sure you take the course with the best rated professor.

Unfortunately, since the extension is not usable nor testable by Firefox Extension reviewers, the addon has been taken down from the extension library.
While I attempt to re enable the addon to be available, use the .xpi package.
